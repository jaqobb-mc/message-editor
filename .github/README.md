# Message Editor

Edit in-game messages that were previously unmodifiable. Message Editor allows server owners to edit default server messages or messages from other plugins, in an easy and user-friendly way. This is a perfect solution to edit messages that are hardcoded in plugins or server software and cannot be changed otherwise.
